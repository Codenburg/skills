## Activation Contract

Use only when the user explicitly invokes `/agents-md-manager init`, `/agents-md-manager update`, or `/agents-md-manager audit`. Manage the root `AGENTS.md` lifecycle as an evidence-based context router; nested instruction files are read-only evidence.

## Hard Rules

- Expose exactly `init`, `update`, and `audit`; manage only the root `<root>/AGENTS.md` and exactly one ordered marker pair.
- Use Git only as narrow read-only evidence. Never stage, commit, push, reset, rebase, checkout, restore user work, amend, clean, or otherwise mutate Git state; this applies to every mode, including adoption and update.
- Preserve the prefix through the start marker and suffix from the end marker onward byte-for-byte. Keep current valid wording and order when meaning and evidence remain current; change only evidence-affected guidance, and never perform stylistic whole-region rewrites.
- Treat `ABSENT`, `MANAGED`, `UNMANAGED`, and `MALFORMED` as the only public lifecycle states. Report unsafe targets as a separate internal safety finding, not as a fifth lifecycle state.
- Reject any symlink component in the supplied root path, use the canonical physical root, capture its directory identity, and fail closed on detected root or target changes. Require safe-open capabilities; never read or mutate with missing no-follow/nonblocking primitives.
- `audit` never writes. `init` writes only `ABSENT`; `update` writes only `MANAGED`, or appends to `UNMANAGED` after explicit approval for this current workflow. `MALFORMED` always stops without mutation.
- Route only existing, evidence-backed, repository-relative sources. Read selectively; never inspect secrets, recursively dump Markdown, scan projects semantically, enumerate skills, or create foundation/Graphify/catalog integrations.
- Use project-declared precedence when present. Otherwise emit `CONFLICTING_CONTEXT` with both paths, claims, affected rule, and missing evidence, then omit uncertain guidance.
- Use the stdlib-only mechanical helper at [`scripts/agents-md-region.mjs`](scripts/agents-md-region.mjs); it classifies, preserves, writes, and verifies bytes but never discovers semantic evidence.

## Decision Gates

| Mode/state | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `init` + `ABSENT` | Inspect bounded evidence and create the root managed region only. |
| `init` + any present state | Report the state; change nothing. |
| `update` + `MANAGED` | Replace only the exact interior; an equivalent candidate is a no-op. |
| `update` + `UNMANAGED` | Show the semantic proposal, then require explicit current-workflow adoption approval. |
| `update` + `MALFORMED` or `ABSENT` | Stop and report; change nothing. |
| `audit` + any state | Report evidence and preservation checks; change nothing. |

## Execution Steps

1. Load [`references/agents-md-contract.md`](references/agents-md-contract.md) and mechanically classify the fixed root target before reading project content. If it is unsafe, do not follow or read it; report the safety finding separately from lifecycle state.
2. Discover semantic evidence selectively: high-signal indexes, manifests, task runners, CI/test configuration, and task-relevant docs or source. Record routes, exact evidenced commands, precedence, stale pointers, and conflicts.
3. Build a candidate payload in the applicable small conceptual order: `Project essentials`, `Commands`, `Context routing`, `Mandatory workflows`, `Source precedence`. Omit empty sections; this is an ordering aid, not a rigid template. Keep runtime context classes ephemeral.
4. Apply the mode/state/adoption gate, then use the helper for a safe write or a no-op. Revalidate at each exposed mutation boundary, preserve regular-file mode, and use only same-directory temporary atomic replacement with cleanup where replacement is needed.
5. Use the helper to verify target safety, one exact ordered marker pair, the complete candidate bytes, exact payload, and prefix/suffix or adoption-prefix preservation. Return the compact report only after verification; surface any temporary cleanup failure explicitly.

## Output Contract

Return `Mode`, public `State`, `Mutation`, `Routes`, `Commands`, `Preservation`, `Conflicts`, and `Next action`. For read-only, stopped, or semantically idempotent results, state exactly `Mutation: none` and `Files changed: None`. Name `CONFLICTING_CONTEXT` findings exactly.
